# My first real try on the responsive layout.
This project comes from a course by [@kevin-powell](https://github.com/kevin-powell):   
[Conquering Responsive Layouts](https://courses.kevinpowell.co/conquering-responsive-layouts) :muscle: &nbsp; 

I am glad that I took this challenge because it turned out to be priceless when it comes to understanding and consolidating\
the fundamental concepts such as **flex property**.
## The project requires knowledge of:
1. HTML
2. CSS

+ JavaScritp not required as Kevin provides a starting code with a working nav toggle.
+ I ignored it and added one when I knew how to do it :sunglasses:
